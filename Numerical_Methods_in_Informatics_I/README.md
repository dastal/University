 Numerical Methods Course

The course presented the basic numerical techniques to solve the mathematical problems that frequently arise in science, informatics, and other disciplines. More specifically, the course covered the following topics: 
- Solution of nonlinear equations and of systems of linear equations
- Approximations of data and functions
- Integration and differentiation
- Approximation of eigenvalues
- Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations
- An introduction to numerical optimization. 

For each topic, the fundamental numerical methods, along with the related algorithms, are presented. The exercises were programmed in Matlab.

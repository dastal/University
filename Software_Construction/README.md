Software Construction Basics

This course was about the basics of software construction, including the basics of agile development, design patterns, testing etc.
In the project we needed to build a "task-sorting-tool" by using the topological sort algorithm and one ore more design patterns. The programming language used for this project was Eiffel because our lecturer was Bertrand Meyer.

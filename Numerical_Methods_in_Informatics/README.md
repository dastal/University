# Numerical Methods in Informatics

## Course Specification
The course presents the basic numerical techniques to solve the mathematical problems that frequently arise in science, informatics, and other disciplines, and teaches how to implement them in Matlab. The covered topics are: basic concepts of scientific programming, solution of nonlinear equations and of systems of linear equations; interpolation and least-square approximation of data and functions; integration and differentiation; eigenvalues and eigenvectors computation; and an introduction to numerical optimization.
For this course I used Matlab.

## Folders
Following the content of each folder will be explained in a few words.

### Additional
Contains the Homeworks of the previous years (2019 and 2018).

### Docs
Contains all the assignment sheets and exam sheets which I treated during the course.

### Exam
Contains the code of the exam of the course in the fall semester 2020.

### Exercise Sessions
Contains the code of the exercise sessions.

### Homeworks 1-6
Contains the code of the homeworks 1-6 of the course in the fall semester 2020.

### Lecture Exercises
Contains the code of exercises which were treated during the lecture.

### Practice
Contains the code for the exams of previous years (2019 and 2018) as well as the code of the Self Assessment Test and the Simulation Exam. **Important:** The code of the exams 2019 and 2018 is my suggested solution, it was **neither** corrected by the teaching assistants **nor** did they distribute solutions, i.e there is **no guarantee for correctness!**

### Templates
I created this folder exclusively for the exam which was held online since the Corona Pandemic did not allow exams on site. The exam was carried out open book, which meant that the exam included more exercises. To save a little bit of time, I created methods for nearly all the algorithms used in class with the hope that I could just use them instead of writing every algorithm from scratch.

### Homeworks of 2020
I corrected all the exercises during the exercise sessions, so as far as the teaching assistants did not commit any mistakes, the solutions should be correct.

function y = Session2_Functions_Exercise1(x,n,m)
    % Custom circshift function

    % Shifting a matrix by its size is not shifting it; this also
    % solves the issue of negative shift
    n=mod(n,size(x,1));
    m=mod(m,size(x,2));

    % we take the last rows first (as they wrap up), then we apppent
    % the first rows, wich are shifted down; same for the columns
    y0=[x(n+1:end,:);x(1:n,:)];
    y=[y0(:,m+1:end),y0(:,1:m)];
end

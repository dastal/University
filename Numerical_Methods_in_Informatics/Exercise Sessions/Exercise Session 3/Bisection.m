function [x,it] = Bisection(fun, x0, x1, eps)
    % Function looking for the zero of a function by

    % Input:
    %      fun (function handle): the function to find the root for
    %      x0  (float):           the lower bound of the interval
    %      x1  (float):           the upper bound of the interval
    %      eps (float):           the given tolerance
